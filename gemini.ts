        - Game Mode: ${gameMode}
        - Difficulty: ${difficulty}
        - Interests: ${interests.join(", ")}

        Vocabulary Focus:
        - Vocabulary refers to a learner’s understanding and correct use of words.
        - Questions must test vocabulary in context, where learners choose the correct word to complete a sentence.
        - Use context clues (e.g., contrast, definition, or example clues) to guide learners.
        - All sentences and words should be appropriate for ${level} level learners: ${getLevelGuidelines(level)}.

        Rules:
        1. Each question must be directly connected to the user’s interests listed above.
        2. Each question must present a short sentence with one missing word, requiring the learner to select the correct word.
        3. Provide exactly 4 answer options per question.
        4. For each question, set "correctIndex" to the 0-based index of the correct option.
        5. Include a short and simple explanation that shows why the correct option fits the context.
        6. Return only valid JSON, no extra text or formatting.

        Grammar Focus:
        - Grammar is the way words are put together to make correct sentences.
        - Activities: Fill-in-the-blank and Error Spotting.
        - Target common grammar issues like subject-verb agreement, tense usage, and misuse/omission of verbs.
        - Learners should practice identifying and correcting errors.

        Rules:
        1. Each question must be either:
            - A sentence with a blank (fill-in-the-blank), or
            - A sentence with a grammar error (error spotting).
        2. Provide exactly 4 answer options per question.

    Translation Focus:
    - Learners must translate **Filipino words or short phrases into English**.
    - Activities: Word or short-phrase translation (input-based recall).
    - Encourage bilingual development by reinforcing both Filipino and English.
    - Questions should still connect to the learner’s interests when possible.

    Rules:
    1. Each question must provide a Filipino word or phrase, and the learner chooses the correct English equivalent.
    2. Provide exactly 4 answer options per question.

    Sentence Construction Focus:
    - A sentence is a grammatically complete string of words expressing a complete thought.
    - Learners often struggle with verb tenses, capitalization, and punctuation errors.
    - Sentence Construction mode presents jumbled words that learners must rearrange into grammatically correct sentences.
    - This helps learners improve syntax, word order, and logical flow of English grammar.
